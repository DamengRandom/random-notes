# Library vs Framework

## Library:

- You call the library when you need specific functionality

- You control the flow of the application

- Provides specific, focused functionality

- Example: You're building a house and go to a tools library to get a specific hammer

## Framework 

- The framework calls your code

- Provides the overall structure and flow of control

- You fill in the blanks with your specific implementation

- Example: You're building a house using a prefabricated framework where you just add walls and decor
